                    right to cancel your booking if payment is declined for any reason or if you have

                    Golobe may require the card holder to provide additional payment verification 
                    upon request by either submitting an online form or visiting the nearest Golobe 
                    office, or at the airport at the time of check-in. Golobe reserves the right to 
                    deny boarding or to collect a guarantee payment (in cash or from another credit card) 
                    if the card originally used for the purchase cannot be presented by the cardholder 
                    at check-in or when collecting the tickets, or in the case the original payment has 
                    been withheld or disputed by the card issuing bank. Credit card details are held in 
                    a secured environment and transferred through an internationally accepted system.
